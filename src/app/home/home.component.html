Her goal is not only for clients to enjoy the planning and day-of experience but also, for all vendors involved to enjoy the process as well.

          <p>Diana is known amongst friends and family to be a fun and loving person, always extending herself and helping others. If you don't see her hard at work, you'll find her dancing and entertaining, spending time with her beautiful family or traveling to an Island for a little relaxation.</p>
